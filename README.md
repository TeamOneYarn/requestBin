Routes Notes:
GET '/'
Create Random String 
-This will create a new `row` for the `users` table.
-We are redirecting the user to another path which was generated by the random string.

----
GET '/:path'
-If random string doesn't exist, send message "user doesn't exist."
- get all requests that belong to the user (with the unique random_string) and display

----
POST '/create/:path'
-Creates subdomain
-Find an id of the user that matches the random string 
-Insert into bins the subdomain and userid
-Redirect to /:path 

----
POST '/'
- get the subdomain from the request sent by the webhook
-Look in the database with the given id then insert subdomain and user_id into the bins table.
-MongoDB document is created.
-Insert into requests table binID and MongoID
-When the insertion is successful, we get a success message.
